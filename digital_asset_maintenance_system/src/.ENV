# /**
#  * This is an example of a .env file.
#  * 
#  * The .env file is used to store environment variables for a project.
#  * It typically contains key-value pairs, where each line represents a variable.
#  * 
#  * This file is often used to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.
#  * It is important to keep this file secure and not share it publicly.
#  * 
#  * In this example, we have three environment variables defined:
#  * - API_KEY: The API key for accessing a third-party service.
#  * - DB_HOST: The hostname of the database server.
#  * - DB_PASSWORD: The password for the database user.
#  * 
#  * These variables can be accessed in the code using a dotenv library or by manually parsing the file.
